Using this map only, we sequenially create a series of layers to be performed in the effect. Like at the first we make the title layer and then an animated sequence of graphics and using some elemnts like delay and random, we decide the timing and random selection of the effect.


## Software Used
1. Meta Spark Stidio v154-- The Studio makes it possible to customize images and videos for both Facebook and Instagram. While creating your own AR filters sounds like a complex undertaking, Spark AR Studio was built to make the process easy. It also comes with a host of features. Here’s a breakdown of each feature and what it enables you to create
2. Meta Spark Player-- The Player is used in testing the filter we make using the studio.  

## What is AR Filter?

Augmented reality (AR) filters are computer-generated effects designed to be superimposed on real-life images. AR filters work with your camera, adding a layer or imagery in the foreground or background of your image. There’s a good chance you’ve come into contact with an AR filter in one way or another on Instagram.
